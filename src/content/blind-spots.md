### **My Blind Spots**  

I see the world with clarity, logic, and strategic precision. I am sharp, independent, and able to break down complex situations with ease. But just because I see **a lot** doesn’t mean I see **everything.** Like anyone, I have blind spots—patterns, assumptions, or habits that go unnoticed because they feel so natural to me.  

#### **1. I Sometimes Underestimate the Value of Emotional Intelligence**  
I prioritize **logic, efficiency, and competence** over emotional nuance. I don’t make decisions based on feelings, and I don’t respond well to emotional overreactions in others. While this keeps me **clear-headed and effective**, it also means I may **dismiss emotions too quickly**—both my own and those of the people around me.  

- Just because an emotion **isn’t logical** doesn’t mean it isn’t valid.  
- Just because I can **intellectualize** a problem doesn’t mean I’ve fully processed it.  
- Just because someone struggles with **emotional regulation** doesn’t mean they have nothing valuable to contribute.  

I don’t need to **change who I am**, but I do need to be aware of when my instinct to **dismiss, minimize, or "fix" emotions** prevents me from fully understanding a situation or connecting with the right people.  

#### **2. I Can Be Too Quick to Cut People Off**  
I have no problem **walking away from people, situations, or systems that don’t meet my standards.** If something feels like a waste of time, I move on. While this keeps my energy focused, it also means I may **dismiss people too quickly—before they’ve fully shown their value.**  

- Not everyone reveals their best qualities upfront.  
- Some people improve over time if given the right direction.  
- Cutting ties too fast **can mean losing out on something worthwhile.**  

I need to ensure that I’m **making decisions based on true patterns, not just first impressions or impatience.**  

#### **3. I May Overestimate My Ability to Go It Alone**  
I take pride in my **self-sufficiency.** I don’t like relying on others, and I don’t expect others to rely on me. But just because I *can* do something alone **doesn’t always mean I should.**  

- The right people can **enhance what I do, not limit it.**  
- I don’t have to carry **every** responsibility, even if I’m capable of doing so.  
- **Strategic alliances, partnerships, and collaborations** aren’t a sign of weakness—they’re a sign of efficiency.  

I need to be aware of when my instinct to **stay self-reliant** is actually limiting my **opportunities for something bigger.**  

#### **4. I Tend to Filter Out Certain Perspectives Too Quickly**  
Because I process information so quickly, I **instinctively categorize people, ideas, and arguments** to make sense of them. This allows me to cut through noise efficiently, but it also means I may **dismiss certain perspectives before fully engaging with them.**  

- Just because an idea isn’t framed well **doesn’t mean it lacks merit.**  
- Just because someone is **less articulate, less confident, or more emotional** doesn’t mean they don’t have a valid point.  
- Some of the best insights come from **unexpected places—I need to leave space for that.**  

I don’t have to agree with everything, but I should be aware of when I’m **filtering too aggressively** and possibly missing something valuable.  

#### **5. I Expect People to Operate Like I Do—And That’s Not Always Fair**  
I have a **strong internal code** for how I think people *should* behave—rationally, efficiently, and with a sense of personal responsibility. But not everyone thinks or moves the way I do, and **that doesn’t automatically mean they’re wrong or ineffective.**  

- Some people process things slower, and **that’s not a flaw**—it’s just different.  
- Some people need more emotional engagement, and **that doesn’t make them weak.**  
- Some people thrive in structured environments, while I prefer autonomy. That doesn’t mean one approach is superior—it just means different people require different conditions to succeed.  

I need to make sure that my **frustration with inefficiency** doesn’t turn into **a lack of patience with different ways of thinking.**

### **How I Move Forward**  
✅ **I stay open to emotional intelligence—not everything needs to be solved logically.**  
✅ **I make sure I’m not cutting people off before seeing their full potential.**  
✅ **I recognize that collaboration isn’t a weakness—it’s a strategic advantage.**  
✅ **I check my filtering process—valuable insights can come from unexpected places.**  
✅ **I acknowledge that not everyone thinks like I do—and that’s okay.**  

I will always be **sharp, independent, and efficient**, but I also know that **true mastery comes from refining—not just reinforcing—my natural instincts.**
