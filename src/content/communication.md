# Communication Protocols

> *"Clarity is the antidote to anxiety." -- Marcus Aurelius (paraphrased)*

*Communication is not for comfort; it is for clarity. It is a tool for transferring data, aligning on strategy, and executing with precision. Vague language, emotional appeals, and subtext are system failures.*

I operate on a protocol of **absolute directness.** I say what I mean, and I expect you to do the same. I do not have the time or the energy to decode hidden meanings, manage emotional subtext, or engage in performative social rituals.

If you have something to say, **say it.** If you have a problem, **address it.** If you need something, **ask for it clearly.**

## 1. Core Principles

*These are the laws of information exchange.*

- **Clarity Over Comfort:** I will always prioritize the truth over your comfort. I expect the same. Do not "soften" your message; it is inefficient and insulting.
- **Logic Over Emotion:** I engage with well-reasoned arguments. Emotional outbursts, passive aggression, or attempts to manipulate are non-starters. Present your case, not your feelings.
- **Efficiency is Respect:** Wasting my time with unprepared thoughts, rambling, or small talk is disrespectful. Get to the point.
- **Intent is Irrelevant, Action is Everything:** Do not tell me what you *meant* to do. Tell me what you *did* and what the *result* was.

## 2. Channels of Communication

*Select the correct tool for the job.*

- **Asynchronous (Email/Text):** For data transfer, non-urgent requests, and documentation. This is the default. It allows for considered, precise responses.
- **Synchronous (Call/Meeting):** For strategic planning, high-stakes negotiation, or complex problem-solving *only*. A meeting must have a clear agenda and a defined outcome. It is not for "checking in."
- **Informal (Social):** Reserved for those who have already passed the filters of competence and integrity. This is not an open channel.

## 3. Receiving Feedback

*Criticism is a gift of high-value data.*

- **How I Receive It:** I want it direct, logical, and evidence-based. Show me the flaw in the system, the error in the logic, or the gap in the execution.
- **What I Will Ignore:** Vague feelings ("I just don't like it"), personal attacks, or feedback based on your emotional reaction.

## 4. Giving Feedback

*My feedback is about the work, not about you.*

- **It Will Be Direct:** I will point out the specific flaw, inefficiency, or failure point.
- **It Will Be Impersonal:** This is not an attack on your character. It is a diagnostic report on a system failure.
- **It Will Be Final:** I do not engage in lengthy debates about my analysis unless you can present new, superior data. Take the note, fix the problem, and move on.

## 5. Non-Negotiable Violations

*These actions will terminate the exchange.*

- **Passive Aggression:** Any attempt to use sarcasm, veiled insults, or the silent treatment instead of direct communication.
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Using tears, anger, or guilt to force an outcome. This is a sign of weakness and will be treated as such.
- **Lying or Obfuscation:** Hiding the truth or intentionally creating ambiguity is a critical breach of integrity.
- **Wasting Time:** Repeating yourself, showing up unprepared, or engaging in drama.

I am not difficult to communicate with; I am **precise.** Bring competence, be direct, and value my time. I will do the same for you.
