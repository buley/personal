# Competition and Collaboration

> *“Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.” -- Sun Tzu*

> *"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." -- Helen Keller*

*Competition isn't about beating others, and collaboration isn't about working together. Both are strategic tools for building long-term, systemic advantages.*

I don't compete to win--I position myself to make winning inevitable.

I don't collaborate for connection--I align with others for strategic advantage.

Every interaction, whether competitive or collaborative, must serve a larger strategic purpose.
