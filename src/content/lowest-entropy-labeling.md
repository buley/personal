# Lowest-Entropy Labeling

*A compact, testable name for a pattern that minimizes assumptions and maximizes actionability.*

### Principles

- Short, specific, operational
- Observable facts over motives
- Low theory, low ambiguity, high utility
- Guides the next move, not a story about the past

### How to Label (3 steps)

1) Describe context + behavior + condition

2) Include a measurable or falsifiable element

3) Choose words you can test within a week

### Format Templates

- “When [context], [behavior] under [condition].”
- “If [trigger], then [effect] within [timeframe].”
- “[Metric threshold] predicts [outcome] next [period].”

### Examples (Better vs. Vague)

- “Overstimulation after 2 back‑to‑back meetings” vs. “social anxiety”
- “Decision fatigue after 4pm” vs. “poor willpower”
- “Sleep debt > 60 minutes drives reactivity next morning” vs. “bad mood”
- “Open‑loop email threads drain focus” vs. “email is stressful”
- “Context switching > 3 times per hour cuts throughput by half” vs. “scattered”

### Anti‑patterns

- Motive labels: “lazy,” “defiant,” “needy”
- Identity labels: “I’m just not disciplined”
- Theory bundles: multi‑cause guesses in one phrase
- Poetry: clever words that don’t change a decision

### Quick Checks

- Can you measure it?
- Can you act on it today?
- Would a neutral observer agree?
- Does it suggest a lever immediately?

### From Label → Lever

- Reduce uncertainty: pick the smallest test that would falsify it
- Select one lever: time, environment, sequence, script, or constraint
- Define a review point: what signal would make you keep or kill the label?

### Lever Menu (common mappings)

- Overstimulation → insert 10‑minute sensory reset; cap back‑to‑back at 2
- Decision fatigue → move high‑stakes choices before 1pm; use preset options
- Sleep‑reactivity → protect bedtime window; no new conflicts after 8pm
- Open‑loops drain → daily 30‑minute loop‑closure block; scripted replies
- Context switching → batch by domain; 45‑minute focus blocks; queue changes

### Micro‑Workflow

1) Observe without story

2) Write the lowest‑entropy label

3) Pick one lever and a 25–50 minute container

4) Run one cycle

5) Log outcome and keep/kill decision

### Minimal Metrics

- Count of active labels this week
- Close‑rate on tests run vs. planned
- Effect size per lever (small/medium/large)

### FAQ

- Why “entropy”? Fewer assumptions = fewer ways to be wrong. The label carries maximum signal per word.
- How short is short enough? If you need conjunctions beyond one “after/when/if,” split it into two labels.
