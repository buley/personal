# Manifesto: Unshakable

> *“The surest way to corrupt a youth is to instruct him to hold in higher esteem those who think alike than those who think differently.” — Friedrich Nietzsche*

*A manifesto is not a preference—it is a declaration of non-negotiable standards that shape reality.*

I am fiercely independent, relentlessly driven, and unapologetically original.

My path is my own, forged by vision, discipline, and a refusal to accept mediocrity.

I don't follow convention—I challenge it.

I don't seek validation—I create impact.

I don't settle—I build.
