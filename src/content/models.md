# Mental Models

> *"The map is not the territory." -- Alfred Korzybski*

> *"All models are wrong, but some are useful." -- George Box*

*My mind is not a container for facts; it is an engine for processing reality. These models are the core algorithms I use to analyze, decide, and execute.*

These are not beliefs. They are **cognitive tools**—lenses to clarify complexity, frameworks to identify leverage, and systems to execute strategy.

## 1. Systems Thinking

*Everything is a system. Nothing exists in isolation.*

- **Description:** No event or entity is independent. All are components interacting within larger, dynamic systems. I do not look at the *thing*; I look at the *relationships*, *incentives*, and *feedback loops* that govern it.
- **Application:** Instead of treating symptoms (e.g., "I am unproductive"), I diagnose the system failure (e.g., "My inputs are distracting, my energy is low, and the objective is unclear"). I don't fix the part; I re-engineer the process.

## 2. First Principles

*Deconstruct to the fundamental truths.*

- **Description:** A problem cannot be solved from the same level of assumption that created it. I break every challenge down to its axiomatic truths—the things I *know* to be true—and build a solution from that foundation.
- **Application:** When told "We can't do that," I ask "Why?" I drill past tradition, convention, and "best practices" to the core physics of the problem. This is how I find the unconventional—and superior—path.

## 3. Leverage (80/20 Principle)

*Identify the 20% of effort that creates 80% of the results.*

- **Description:** Outcomes are not distributed evenly. A few key inputs, decisions, or actions will generate the vast majority of the impact.
- **Application:** I relentlessly analyze: What is the *one* thing that, if executed perfectly, would make everything else easier or irrelevant? I apply my energy to that leverage point. I refuse to waste time on the low-impact 80%.

## 4. Signal vs. Noise

*Not all information is created equal.*

- **Description:** Most information is "noise"—distracting, irrelevant, or emotionally charged. "Signal" is the rare, high-value data that reveals the underlying truth or a strategic opportunity.
- **Application:** I filter reality through a low-pass filter. I ignore hype, drama, opinions, and consensus. I look for the data, the patterns, and the "why" beneath the surface.

## 5. Antifragility

*What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.*

- **Description:** This model, from Nassim Taleb, goes beyond mere resilience (surviving a shock). An antifragile system *benefits* from shock, volatility, and stress. It feeds on chaos to grow stronger.
- **Application:** I do not avoid failure; I *harvest it for data*. Every setback, criticism, or crisis is an opportunity to identify a weakness, adapt the system, and evolve to a higher state of capability. I deliberately introduce stressors (e.g., new challenges) to force adaptation.

## 6. Sunk Cost Fallacy

*The past has no vote.*

- **Description:** The human tendency to continue an endeavor because of previously invested resources (time, money, emotion) is irrational.
- **Application:** My decisions are based *only* on the *future* cost and *future* benefit. I will walk away from a project, investment, or relationship instantly if it no longer serves the strategic objective, regardless of what I have already put in. I cut losses without emotion.

## 7. Inversion

*Think backward to move forward.*

- **Description:** Instead of asking "How do I achieve success?" I ask, "What are all the things that could *guarantee failure*?" Then, I systematically avoid them.
- **Application:** This model is a powerful tool for risk mitigation and clarity. By identifying and eliminating the paths to failure (e.g., wasting time, breaking integrity, acting on emotion), the path to success becomes the only one left.

## 8. Circle of Competence

*Know what you know, and know what you don't.*

- **Description:** I have a clear, honest, and ruthless understanding of my own strengths and weaknesses.
- **Application:** I operate with dominant force *inside* my circle of competence. I am extremely cautious, or I *delegate*, *automate*, or *eliminate* tasks *outside* of it. I do not let ego push me into domains where I cannot win.
