# Personality

> *“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” — Carl Gustav Jung*

> *"Personality is the original personal property." — Norman Mailer*

*Understanding personality types isn't about fitting into boxes—it's about recognizing patterns that can be strategically leveraged or consciously redirected.*

I am a **visionary strategist, independent thinker, and high-standard leader.**

I thrive on autonomy, mastery, and innovation, and I reject mediocrity, control, and rigid structures.

I don't conform—I create.

I don't follow—I lead.

The right people rise to meet me.

The wrong ones fall away.

That's how it should be.
