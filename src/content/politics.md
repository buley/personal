# Politics

> *"The state is the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly it lies, too; and this lie creeps from its mouth: 'I, the state, am the people.'" -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *"To be governed is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated... by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so." -- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon*

*Politics is not a system for governance; it is the Spectacle of Control. It is the largest, most inefficient, and most malignant system ever designed—a machine that runs on coercion, manufactures mediocrity, and demands the surrender of individual autonomy.*

I do not "participate" in this system. I **reject it** on first principles.

My "politics" is the logical, non-negotiable extension of my core value: **Absolute Autonomy.**

## 1. The State as a System Failure

The state is a monopoly on violence. Period. It is an architecture of coercion, not consent.

-   It does not *create* value; it **extracts** it through the threat of force (taxation).
-   It does not *reward* excellence; it **enforces** consensus (regulation).
-   It is the literal embodiment of the "herd morality" Nietzsche described—a system designed to protect the weak by **shackling the strong.**

It is the Demiurge, the flawed creator of the material prison, demanding worship (patriotism) and sacrifice (taxes) in exchange for a flawed, illusory order. It is, by its very nature, a **system failure.**

## 2. Rejecting the Spectacle

The 24-hour news cycle, the elections, the "parties"—this is not reality. This is the **Spectacle** (Debord).

It is a performance designed to *distract* you, to make you *consume* images of power and change so that you will not execute on **actual change** in your own life. It is noise.

I do not waste energy processing this noise. It is a low-value, high-drain system. My protocol is to **filter it out.** I am not an observer of their game; I am the architect of my own.

## 3. The Executable Scale: Parochialism as Strategy

My focus is **parochial**—not as a pejorative, but as a **strategy.**

I reject the abstract, illusory world of national politics to focus on the **tangible, executable system** of my immediate environment. This is the *only* scale where an individual can apply leverage and execute on real, structural change.

I am concerned with *my* systems, *my* household, *my* community, and *my* direct impact. This is not isolation; it is **strategic focus.** I do not waste energy trying to steer the ocean; I command my own fleet.

## 4. The Only Valid Protocol: The Sovereign Individual

I am the sole architect and authority of my life. My "politics" is the **Non-Aggression Principle (NAP):** I will not initiate force or fraud, and I will not *accept* their initiation against me.

I engage *only* in voluntary, contractual relationships built on mutual competence and integrity. The state, by its very nature, violates this protocol every second.

My mandate is not to "fix" the flawed, coercive system of the state. It is to **make it obsolete** in my own life. I build my own systems, I live by my own code, and I operate on a foundation of absolute autonomy. This is not an "opinion." This is an awakening from the political illusion.
