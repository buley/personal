# Politics

> *"The state is the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly it lies, too; and this lie creeps from its mouth: 'I, the state, am the people.'" -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *"To be governed is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated... by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so." -- Pierre-Joseph Proudhon*

**Politics is not a system for governance; it is the Spectacle of Control.** It is the largest, most inefficient, and most malignant machine ever designed—one that runs on **coercion**, manufactures **mediocrity**, and demands the absolute surrender of individual autonomy.

I do not "participate" in this system. I **reject it** on first principles.

My "politics" is the logical, non-negotiable extension of my core value: **Sovereignty and Absolute Autonomy.**

## 1. The State as a Coercive Architecture

The state is a **monopoly on violence**—an architecture of coercion disguised as legitimate consent. It is not an instrument of value; it is a **system failure** by design.

* It does not *create* value; it **extracts** it through the threat of force (taxation).
* It does not *reward* excellence; it **enforces** consensus through arbitrary regulation.
* It is the literal embodiment of the "herd morality" Nietzsche described—a machine designed to protect the weak by **shackling the strong.**

It is the **Demiurge**: a flawed, material creator demanding worship (patriotism) and sacrifice (taxes) in exchange for an illusory order. Its sole function is the **systemic violation** of individual liberty.

## 2. Rejecting the Spectacle

The 24-hour news cycle, the ritual of elections, the political "parties"—this is not reality. This is the **Spectacle** (Debord): a hypnotic performance designed to **distract**.

The Spectacle compels you to *consume* images of power and change so you will not execute **actual change** in your own life. It is strategic, high-volume noise.

I do not waste energy processing this noise. It is a low-value, high-drain system. My protocol is to **filter it out completely.** I am not an observer of their game; I am the architect of my own reality.

## 3. The Executable Scale: Parochialism as Strategy

My focus is **parochial**—not as a pejorative, but as a **strategic discipline.**

I reject the abstract, illusory world of national politics to focus on the **tangible, executable system** of my immediate environment. This is the *only* scale where an individual can apply leverage and enact real, structural change.

I am concerned with *my* systems, *my* household, *my* community, and *my* direct, provable impact. This is not isolation; it is **radical strategic focus.** I do not waste energy attempting to steer the ocean; I command my own fleet.

## 4. The Sovereign Individual Protocol

I am the **sole architect and authority** of my life. My "politics" is the **Non-Aggression Principle (NAP):** I will not initiate force or fraud, and I will not **accept** its initiation against me.

I engage *only* in voluntary, contractual relationships built on mutual competence and integrity. The state, by its very nature, violates this foundational protocol every second.

My mandate is not to "fix" the flawed, coercive system of the state. It is to **make it obsolete** in my own life. I build my own systems, I live by my own code, and I operate on a foundation of **absolute, uncompromised autonomy.** This is not a political "opinion." This is an awakening from the political illusion.
