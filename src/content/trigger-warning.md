### **⚠️ Trigger Warning: Dealing With Me**  

Proceed with caution. I am independent, highly analytical, and unapologetically direct. I do not sugarcoat reality, tolerate mediocrity, or entertain unnecessary drama. If you require constant validation, prefer comfort over growth, or expect blind agreement, you may find interacting with me… **challenging.**  

I value truth over politeness, efficiency over tradition, and excellence over participation trophies. I am not here to fit in—I am here to **build, solve, and lead.**  

If you thrive on intellectual challenge, strategic thinking, and relentless improvement, you’ll do just fine. If not, consider yourself warned.
