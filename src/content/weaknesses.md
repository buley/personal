### **Acknowledging My Weaknesses**  

I hold myself to high standards, but I recognize that my strengths come with sharp edges. My **independence** can make me resistant to collaboration when I don’t respect the competency of others. My **high standards** can make me impatient with inefficiency or slow progress. My **nonconformity** can sometimes lead me to reject structure, even when it serves a purpose.  

I can be **blunt** when I see flaws, and I don’t always filter my critiques to make them more digestible. I am **selective with my energy**, which means I don’t invest in relationships or projects that don’t challenge me. I can also be **overly self-reliant**, sometimes pushing forward alone when a strategic alliance would serve me better.  

I recognize that not every battle needs to be fought, not every system needs to be reinvented, and that patience is sometimes as valuable as action. **Growth for me is learning when to refine my intensity rather than diminish it.**
